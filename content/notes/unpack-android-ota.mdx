Short answer: use https://github.com/AndroidDumps/dumpyara , which will dump almost everything of interest.

To unpack individual images: use [`payload-dumper-go`](https://github.com/ssut/payload-dumper-go), which is available in ArchLinuxCN repo.

If you REALLY want to do it by hand, here is the way to extract individual images from `super.img`:

If `super.img` is a sparse image, then we need to unsparse it first.

```bash
$ file imgs/CN/super.img  
imgs/CN/super.img: Android sparse image, version: 1.0, Total of 2228224 4096-byte output blocks in 141 input chunk  
s.
```

Use `simg2img` from Arch Linux `extra/android-tools` package to unsparse it.

```bash
simg2img super.img super.img.unsparsed
```

Then we can unpack it using `lpunpack` from Arch Linux `extra/android-tools` package.

```bash
mkdir dump
lpunpack super.img.unsparsed dump
```
