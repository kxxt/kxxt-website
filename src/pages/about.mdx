# About Me

Hello there, I am **kxxt** ðŸ‘‹, a senior undergraduate from **Shandong University (Weihai Campus)**.

I major in **data science and AI** at **the School of Mathematics and Statistics**. But I also always have a good passion for anything related to computers.

I am a native Chinese speaker but I also use English.

Now I am a [senior intern](https://github.com/plctlab/weloveinterns/blob/master/outstanding-interns.md)
at [**PLCT lab**](https://github.com/plctlab/weloveinterns) working on software packaging for RISCV64 Arch Linux.

## Tech Stacks

I learned to program in C/C++/C# when I was in junior and senior high school.
At first, I started learning the C/C++ programming language, but I could only write some simple console programs. Later, I tried to learn Windows application development, but MFC and the Windows API were both too difficult for me at the time.
Later, I learned C#, and this time I learned how to use the WinForm and WPF frameworks to write Windows desktop applications.

As I grew older, I learned

- Python for Web Scrapers, Backend, Data Science, Computer Vision, AI and more.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for doing frontend works.
- A little bit of Unity3D for game development.

I have some experience with React, Vue, Next.js and TypeScript.
I have a lot of experience with Gatsby.js as you can see that my personal website is powered by Gatsby. By the way, I also uses SCSS to some extent.
I have fallen in love with Rust since I learned it for the third time (I gave up twice due to its steep learning curve).

While attending university,
I learned to use OpenCV, pytorch and numpy, etc.
I also learned to write programs for Arduino-compatible boards.
I learned R and Matlab for course purpose but I do not use them for my side projects so I might have forgotten some details and quirks of them.
By the way, I know just enough about Mathematica to do some simple symbolic calculations and plots.

I do have some experience with Java(solving algorithm problems) but I haven't practiced it in any serious scenario. Now I even rarely use C# because I often use linux now.

I learned to write Thunderbird add-ons in JavaScript and Obsidian plugins in TypeScript.

I tried to learn Haskell but gave up. I learned F# but I haven't practiced it much.

## Other Skills

- I have a good understanding of the Linux operating system and I have been using it as my primary operating system for more than 3 years.
- I use Git for version control.
- I use Docker to build and run containers and have basic knowledge of Kubernetes(But I haven't got a chance to practice it).
- I have some experience with Makefiles.
- I am familiar with writing LaTeX equations inside Markdown files. But I do not have too much expertise in authoring LaTeX docs.
- I have some experience with writing shell scripts but I am not good at it.
- I possess a working knowledge and some fundamental experience in packaging software for Arch Linux and Debian[^1].

## Software that I use

Here are some extraordinary applications that keep me happy and productive.

### Operating Systems

- **Garuda Linux(Primary)**: Garuda Linux is a rolling distribution based on the Arch Linux operating system.
  - I use it for my daily work and it works perfectly.
- **Windows**: Now I only use it for gaming and tasks that require Windows or when I want to use my laptop as a tablet PC.
- **Debian**: I use it on my server due to its stability.
- **LineageOS**: I use it on my phone.

### Browsers

- **Firefox**: I use it as my primary browser.
- **Chromium**: I use it for some websites that are not compatible with Firefox and for debugging purpose.

### IDEs

- **Visual Studio Code**: I use it for most of my projects.
- **Visual Studio**: I use it for C# projects.
- **PyCharm**: Sometimes I use it for Python projects.

### Other Software

- **Obsidian**: I use it to manage my notes and knowledge.
- **Thunderbird**: I use it to manage my emails and calendars.
- **Typora**: I use it to write markdown files.
- **Steam, Epic, Ubisoft**: For gaming.
- **Zsh**: I use it as my shell.
- **Slidev**: I use it to write slides in Markdown.

## My Hobbies

Except for programming, I also have some other hobbies. Here are some of them.

- Gaming: I love Assassin's Creed series.
- Reading: I love reading books and blogs, here is my [reading list](https://t.me/kxxt_read).
- Listening to light music and podcasts.
- Riding my bike.

## Open Source

I am a big fan of open source software and I have contributed to some projects and wrote some of my own.

Here are some cool projects of mine: **(Click on the picture to view the full picture)**

## Other Experience

I learned ROS(Robot Operating System) in a school course. I am planning to learn Zig programming language.

I have participated in [Open-Source OS Training Comp 2022](https://github.com/LearningOS/rust-based-os-comp2023/tree/comp2022)
but I haven't finished the second stage yet. I have learned a lot about operating system development and riscv64 architecture from this project.

I have participated in some CTF competitions and I have learned a lot on information security from them.
