# About Me

Hello there, I am **kxxt**, a junior undergraduate from **Shandong University (Weihai Campus)**.

I major in **data science and AI** at **the School of Mathematics and Statistics**. But I also always have a good passion for anything related to computers.

I am a native Chinese speaker but I also use English.

## Tech Stacks

I learned to program in C/C++/C# when I was in junior and senior high school.

Specifically, I learned WinForms and Windows Presentation Foundation(WPF) to create useful desktop applications.

As I grew older, I learned
- Python for Web Scrapers, Backend, Data Science, Computer Vision, AI and more.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for doing frontend works.

I have some experience with React, Vue, Next.js and TypeScript.
I have a lot of experience with Gatsby.js as you can see that my personal website is powered by Gatsby. By the way, I also uses SCSS to some extent.
I have fallen in love with Rust since I learned it for the third time (I gave up twice due to its steep learning curve).

While attending university,
I learned to use OpenCV, pytorch and numpy, etc.
I also learned to write programs for Arduino-compatible boards.
I learned R and Matlab for course purpose but I do not use them for my side projects so I might have forgotten some details and quirks of them.

I do have some experience with Java(solving algorithm problems) but I haven't practiced it in any serious scenario. Now I even rarely use C# because I primarily use linux now. 

I learned to write Thunderbird add-ons in JavaScript and Obsidian plugins in TypeScript.

I tried to learn Haskell but gave up. I learned F# but I haven't practiced it much.

## Other Skills

- I have a good understanding of the Linux operating system and I have been using it as my primary operating system for more than 3 years.
- I use Git for version control.
- I use Docker to build and run containers and have basic knowledge of Kubernetes(But I haven't practiced it).
- I have some experience with Makefiles.
- I am familiar with writing LaTeX equations inside Markdown files. But I do not have too much expertise in authoring LaTeX docs.
- I have some experience with writing shell scripts but I am not good at it.
- I have working knowledge and some very basic experience with packaging software for Arch Linux and Debian.

## Software that I use

Here are some extraordinary applications that keep me happy and productive.

- **Garuda Linux(Primary)**: Garuda Linux is a rolling distribution based on the Arch Linux operating system.
    - I use it for my daily work and it works perfectly.
- **Windows**: Now I only use it for gaming and tasks that require Windows or when I want to use my laptop as a tablet PC.
- **Debian**: I use it on my server due to its stability.
- **NixOS**: I want to migrate my laptop to NixOS after NVIDIA reverse prime is supported on Linux.
- **LineageOS**: I use it on my phone.

### Browsers

- **Firefox**: I use it as my primary browser.
- **Chrome**: I use it for some websites that are not compatible with Firefox and for debugging purpose.
